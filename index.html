        <h1>Lost and found cats in Los Angeles</h1>
        <p>Getting the word out early is the key to getting your cat back safely and soundly. Don’t assume your pet will return on his own in a few hours. Don’t wait around to see if he’ll find his way home.</p>
        <p>What to Do if You Lose Your Pet:</p>
    </header>

    <ul>
        <li>GET THE WORD OUT! The more people know you have lost a pet, and that you are upset, worried and desperately trying to find your pet, the more people will call you if they see an animal in the woods or on the road, or in their backyard.</li>
        <li>Call all your neighbors personally.</li>
        <li>Again, DON’T GIVE UP! Be aggressive in your search, get lots of help, get the word out right away – don’t wait a few hours “to see if he’ll come home on his own “– you need those early hours to put up posters and give out cards.</li>
    </ul>
